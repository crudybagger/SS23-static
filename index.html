    <div class="about">
      <p><span>SpringSpree</span> was started in the year 1978 by the students of <span>National Institute of Technology, Warangal</span>. It was an intercollegiate annual sports and cultural event held between January and March every year. Students came up with the idea of holding a small festival, which would lay down a platform for the students to showcase their skills in the areas of sports, athletics and cultural activities. Additionally, the festival was to unify a diverse student body by celebrating the culture of the regions to which they belonged along with the culture of India as a whole. It was the first college festival in southern India and was conducted every year till the end of the 90s. SpringSpree was not conducted for a few years in the early 2000s. Its revival was gradual with small fests from clubs finally giving rise to a mini cultural festival called Elysium in 2006. In 2007, SpringSpree was brought back and has since been an annual event.</p>
